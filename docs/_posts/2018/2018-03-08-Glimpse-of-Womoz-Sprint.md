  To celebrate the gracefulness of womenhood, we celebrated Women's Day in the name of
  **WoMoz Sprint** on the behalf of Dhirajzilla campus club. The session was focussing on encouraging 
  girls to push themselves forward to progress their talents in open web and open source. Opportunities for women in Mozilla 
  was the key focus. A group of 40 participants attend the event where 27 of them were girls. 

  We had a hands-on session on WebVR with the sessional demonstrations of widely discussed
topics of open source community to the score inspired many girls to accomplish the growing technology. 
With avid interest, our club contributors came forward and created VR scene using A-Frame on the
theme of **Press for Progress** during the session. 
  
  The count of girls who came forward were amazing, we strongly believe that they all will be a sustained contributors 
to open source. Thanks to every Women who were a part of us. Hoping to have many events like this focusing the women power.
